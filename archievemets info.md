List of tasks to complete in order to receive unlockables at Residual point lobby.

Mostly made for me so i don't really forgot how the system works. but you're free to get spoiler instead of find them by yourself. since i even didn't a system for tell people about them until they're seen on the lobby x[

**NOTE:** some achievements will be permanently saved while others such as "Body guard" will not. since they change when a npc die. i.e "secret hunter" will change to true once someone pick ups the item. then it'll be always on. but "body guard" IS always ON but when a npc specified die it'll change to false.
